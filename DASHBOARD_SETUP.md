# Assignment Assistant Dashboard - Setup Complete

## Issues Resolved

✅ **API Key Configuration**: The Bubble API key has been configured and is working properly
✅ **Dependencies Installed**: All required Python packages have been installed
✅ **Port Configuration**: Changed from port 5000 to 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay conflict
✅ **API Connection**: Successfully connecting to Bubble API and fetching data

## Current Status

The dashboard is now running and successfully fetching data from Bubble:
- **Total Users**: 1,675
- **Total Conversations**: 8,990  
- **Total Messages**: 9,856
- **API Endpoints**: All working (/api/stats, /api/metrics, /api/conversations, chart endpoints)

## How to Access the Dashboard

1. **Current Session**: The dashboard is running at http://localhost:5001

2. **To Start in Future**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bennji/Downloads/Assignment-Assistant-Logs
   ./start_dashboard.sh
   ```

3. **Manual Start** (if script doesn't work):
   ```bash
   export BUBBLE_API_KEY_LIVE="your-bubble-api-key-here"
   export SESSION_SECRET="assignment-assistant-secret-key-2025"
   export PORT=5001
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Configuration Files

- **`.env`**: Contains your API key and configuration (keep this secure!)
- **`start_dashboard.sh`**: Convenient startup script
- **`app.py`**: Modified to use port 5001

## Important Notes

1. **Data Limits**: The app fetches a maximum of 2,000 items per data type to prevent timeouts
2. **No Database**: Currently running without a database, fetching directly from Bubble API
3. **Caching**: Data is cached for 10 minutes to improve performance

## Troubleshooting

If the dashboard stops working:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure the Bubble API key is still valid
2. **Check Port**: Make sure port 5001 is not in use
3. **Check Logs**: Run `tail -f app.log` to see error messages
4. **Restart**: Kill any existing processes and restart using the startup script

## Security Note

Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control. The API key provides access to your Bubble data.
